<h1>You Died</h1>
<p style="font-size:175%;">You Investigate crying to see a young girl sitting on the floor with her face in her hands. You approach her with good intent. You place a hand on her shoulder and almost as instantly as you did, she is standing looking at you in your eyes. Her eyes are souless and her grip around your neck is inhuman. Your life fades away as you shake in fear and her hand closes around your throat.
